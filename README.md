## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Links

- Solution URL: [Githublink](https://dmk980.github.io/ip-address-tracker/)
- Live Site URL: [Live Demo](https://ip-address-tracker-mocha-nu.vercel.app/)

- The live demo might not be functioning since the API has a limit on the amount of call for a free plan

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

For this project i learned how to work with external API's and expecially going through documentation which was allitle bit difficult to get a hang of since it was like learning a new technology but i got a hang of it after a while. 

Also working with API's i now have a better understanding of promises and asynchrnous javascript which before was sort of a mystery to me. 

### Continued development

I want to focus on asynchronous javascript to really understand it at a fundamental level.
